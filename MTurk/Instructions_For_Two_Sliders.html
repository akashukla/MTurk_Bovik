<h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <p>
        The two slider bars under each image controls the quality of the image by way of compression. The highest
        quality value is 50, and the lowest quality value is 0. Moving the sliders to the left will decrease 
        the quality of the image. The first slider will be the only one active until the "next" button is pressed.
        After the "next" button is pressed, the first slider will be disabled, and the second slider will jump to
        the position of the first slider.

        <b>Your task:</b> For the first slider bar, adjust the slider and try to find the point at which <b>any distortion 
        is noticeable</b>. If the original image already has noticeable distortion, then leave the slider at 50 and click
        next.<br/>
        As for the second slider, adjust the slider and try to find the point at which sliding the bar <b>just begins 
        to compromise the quality of the image</b>. For example, if the slider is at a certain point 
        <!-- KAN TODO: GIF OF IMAGE AT POINT PLEASE--> 
        and the resulting image's quality is similar to the original's quality even after moving the slider 
        a bit more to the left, 
        <!-- KAN TODO: GIF OF SLIDER MOVING FROM POINT PLEASE--> 
        then you can still move the slider to the left. If the slider is at a certain point and the resulting 
        image's quality is substantially worse than the original's quality,
        <!-- KAN TODO: GIF OF IMAGE AT POINT PLEASE--> 
        then you have moved the slider too far to the left and must move the slider to the right. Your task 
        is <b>not</b> to rate the aesthetic appeal of the image.

        <b>Note:</b> The images may start off with different initial qualities. Because of this, base your 
        answer <b>relative to the original, pristine image</b> (i.e when the slider bar is all the way to the 
        right at 50). With some images, you may need to move the sliders a lot without affecting the 
        quality of images. With others, you may not need to move the sliders too much before noticing a 
        drop in quality.
