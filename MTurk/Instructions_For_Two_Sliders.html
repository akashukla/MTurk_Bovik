<h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <p>
        The two slider bars under each image control the quality of the image by way of compression. The highest
        quality value is 50, and the lowest quality value is 0. Moving the sliders to the left will decrease 
        the quality of the image. Each slider should be moved to a particular point, as discussed below. 
        The first slider will be the only one active until a value is selected and the "next" button is pressed. 
        Then, the first slider will be disabled and the second slider will be activated.
        After a value is chosen for the second slider, click "next" to proceed to the next image.

    <p>
        <b>Your task:</b> For the first slider bar, adjust the slider and try to find the point right before <b>any distortion 
        becomes noticeable</b>. Distortion, in this case, is any change that you can see between the resulting and the original 
        images. In other words, find the slider point furthest to the left where the image still looks exactly 
        like the original image. Below are one good example and two bad examples. <br>
        <!-- TODO: elaborate more on what "distortion" means -->        

        In the good example shown below, the slider is moved as far to the left as possible without causing any noticeable changes
        in the image. Moving the slider any more to the left will cause a distortion in the resulting image, while moving the slider
        to any point to the right of the current position will result in an image that looks the same as the original. 
    </p>   
        <!-- KAN TODO: gif of good first slider, gif of first slider moving to point of first distortion and then pressing next -->
    <p>    
        In this first bad example, the slider is not moved enough to the left. 
    </p>
        <!-- KAN TODO: first slider at 50,  then compressed a little--> 
    <p>
        The resulting image's quality is the same as the original image's quality, even after moving the slider 
        a bit more to the left.
    </p>    
        <!-- KAN TODO: continuing from prev gif, first slider moves from "compressed a little" point to point of first distortion--> 
    <p>
        This means that you can still move the slider to the left. 
        <!-- KAN TODO: continuing from prev gif, first slider moves to the correct point--> 
        <br>
        In the second bad example, the slider is moved too far to the left. The slider is at a certain point, but the resulting 
        image's quality looks different than the original image's quality.
    </p>
        <!-- KAN TODO: gif of first slider moving from 50 to point where image heavily distorted--> 
    <p>
        The slider is too far to the left and should be moved to the right to a higher quality, where the resulting compressed 
        image looks like the original image.
    </p>
        <!-- KAN TODO: continuing from prev gif, first slider moves from "compressed too much" to point of first distortion-->

        <!-- SECOND SLIDER INSTRUCTIONS -->
        For the second slider, adjust the slider and try to find the point where sliding the bar <b>just begins 
        to compromise the quality of the image</b>. The difference between the first and second sliders is that the 
        resulting image and the original image can look different while having the same quality. The first slider asks you
        to find the point where the resulting and original images look different, and the second slider asks you to find
        the point where the difference is so large that the quality of the resulting image is now different from the quality
        of the original image. Below are one good example and two bad examples.<br>
        
        In the good example shown below, the slider is moved as far to the left as possible without causing a change in image
        quality. Moving the slider slightly to the left will cause the resulting image's quality to drop, while moving the slider
        to any point to the right will result in an image that may look different but has the same quality. Notice that differences
        between the resulting image and the original image are noticeable, but are not significant enough to cause a change in quality
        from the original image to the resulting image.
    </p>
        <!-- KAN TODO: gif of good example of slider -->
    <p>
        In the first bad example, the slider is not moved enough to the left, since the image can be compressed further
        without changing the quality of the image. 
    </p>
        <!-- KAN TODO: gif of second slider at starting point,  then compressed a little--> 
    <p>
        The resulting image's quality is similar to the original's quality even after moving the slider 
        a bit more to the left, as shown below.
    </p>
        <!-- KAN TODO: continuing from prev gif, slider moves from "compressed a little" point to left and both images look same/have same quality--> 
    <p>
        This means that you can keep moving the slider further to the left. 
        <!-- KAN TODO: continuing from prev gif, slider moves further to left to correct point -->
        <br>
        In the second bad example, the slider is moved too far to the left, since there is a large drop in quality
        in the resulting image when compared to the original. 
    </p>
        <!-- KAN TODO: gif of second slider at starting point, then compressing too much--> 
    <p>
        In this case, the slider is too far to the left and should be moved back to the right. 
    </p>
        <!-- KAN TODO: continuing from prev gif, slider moves from "compressed too much" to proper spot -->
    <p>
        <b>Note:</b> The images may start off with different initial qualities. Because of this, base your 
        answer <b>relative to the original image</b> (i.e. when the slider bar is all the way to the 
        right at 50). With some images, you may need to move the sliders a lot before seeing changes in the 
        images. With others, you may not need to move the sliders too much before noticing a 
        change. Your task is <b>not</b> to rate the aesthetic appeal of the content of the image.
